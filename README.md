# QuickScripts

The goal of this project is to provide quick & easy scripts for a multitude of situations. 

Folders:

'run-anywhere': These are tools that use nothing but the standard python libraries, and as such, will run just about anywhere that python is installed.

'android-adb': A set of ADB scripts for things


This is incredibly handy for systems with no internet, or ones with ancient python versions.
